I referred to a peacock

the most frustrating things --

You Gone, John Franco" --

'Cause critics have seen it.

done an out-of-town run.

And a lot of the critics
complain that

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:58.363
there's this whole play
about the friendship

00:09:58.363 --> 00:10:00.432
between these two bugs
and then the whole ending

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:02.802
is about, like, complaining
about the Mets.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.606
And there's a lyric
that I'm very proud of that

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.640
that I feel like if anybody --

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.509
if, like, Lin-Manuel Miranda
rhymed

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:13.012

But, like, they were like...

00:10:18.683 --> 00:10:22.688
And I'll just say to all these
out-of-town critics --

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:24.523
If you know so much
about Broadway,

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.826
why do you live in New Haven?

00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:31.363
That is not the best song.

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:32.998
"Where Have You Gone, John
Franco" is not the best song.

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:34.066
The best...

There's the cockroach...

00:10:38.904 --> 00:10:40.238
The cockroach has a song

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:42.975
where he complains
about the smoking ban,

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:44.643
called

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.246

[ Laughter ]

00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:52.651
And then the title song,

00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.920
"Cicada, Cicada" --
everybody's very surprised

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.222
because it's actually
not about bugs at all.

00:10:57.222 --> 00:10:59.224
It is sung

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:02.894
by Cuban-American Jon Secada,

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:05.898

sometimes say his name wrong.

I mean, because again,

00:11:11.469 --> 00:11:14.440
this is the same group of people
every week at our show.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.509
Like, there's no new people
come here.

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.577
You might hear a new laugh.
This is very exciting for me.

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:21.013
One of my oldest friends,
Pete Grosz, is here.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:23.449
He came tonight,
and it's so...

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:27.285
Pete is an award-winning writer.

00:11:27.285 --> 00:11:30.122
He's one of our greatest
living improvisers.

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:32.791
But you may know him...

00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:36.795
If you saw him, you may know
him because for years, he...

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.797
was the Hamburglar.

"Robble robble," my friend.

This is a correction for
somebody who wrote something.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:56.081
This was now months ago

00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.951
and I almost --
I almost wanted to let it go,

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.318
but I kind of can't
get it out of my head,

00:12:00.318 --> 00:12:04.256
so I did want to mention it,
which is...

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:09.428
Someone who I don't think
cares for me.

00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:11.163
And a lot of these corrections,
I can tell

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:13.665
that behind it is...

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:15.835
affection.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:18.003
This was a person
who was referencing the fact

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:21.006
that I am tan.

00:12:21.006 --> 00:12:26.078
And in their comment,
they had one word misspelled,

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:29.414
and it's why I can't
get it out of my head.

00:12:29.414 --> 00:12:31.817
They put an "A" in a word

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.251
where there's not supposed
to be an "A."

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:34.920
So, I'm gonna tell you
what they wrote,

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.256
and see if you can pick out
the misspelling

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:42.160
where there was "A" where
there shouldn't be an "A."

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.800
What they wrote was,
"Hey, bro, what's with the tan?

as Donald Trump."

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:13.692
I mean, don't beat yourself up,
but it massively changes.

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:20.799
I don't even feel like I should
explain what a taint is.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:22.668
It's like the part --
It's like here.

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.870
It's like...

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.338

is fight with you guys

about which
my impressions are good.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.421
Okay, like, it's not...

00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:45.991
Because I'm not mad at you

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.360
about the fact
that you don't

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.464
have an ear for
what people sound like.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.901
But I have come
to the conclusion

00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:59.371
that I do not have
a good Christoph Waltz.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.308
And I only did it
in the first place

00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:06.111
because some of you said
my Werner Herzog

00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:07.579
sounded like Christoph Waltz,
and again,

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:11.116
you were wrong, 'cause
it's unimpeachably good.

00:14:11.116 --> 00:14:13.318
And I feel really bad
because I love Christoph Waltz.

00:14:13.318 --> 00:14:15.587
And I was thinking about like
when he -- and I know for,

00:14:15.587 --> 00:14:17.489
like, foreign audiences,
they may have seen him before.

00:14:17.489 --> 00:14:19.958
But when he showed up
in "Inglourious Basterds,"

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.860
first time
most Americans saw him,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.464
it was like the most
memorable arrival

00:14:25.464 --> 00:14:27.933
of a thespian in film
in the last fif--

00:14:27.933 --> 00:14:30.569
The only thing

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:31.904
that I would say rivals it

00:14:31.904 --> 00:14:34.239
is when I

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:37.476
appear in 2008's "Journey
to the Center of the Earth."

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:50.388

And this is a true story.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.860
I did not have a big part
in this film,

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.963
as evidenced by the fact
that both of my scenes

00:14:57.963 --> 00:15:00.132
took place on the surface
of the Earth.

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:06.305
I was in the first --
one of the first scenes.

00:15:06.305 --> 00:15:10.041
And I'm just going
to paraphrase my scene,

00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:12.477
but I was a scientist who said
something along the lines

00:15:12.477 --> 00:15:14.312
to Brendan Frazier of,

00:15:14.312 --> 00:15:18.450
"You're never going to
the center of the Earth!"

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.953
And then I had a scene at the
very end of the movie, where --

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.121
and again, I'm paraphrasing.

00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:24.289
This wasn't the exact line,

00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:25.324
but something
along the lines of,

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:26.692
"Wha?!"

00:15:29.594 --> 00:15:31.997
But this is a true story.

00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:35.100
They made trading cards.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.702
for "Journey to the Center
of the Earth 3D,"

00:15:37.702 --> 00:15:40.705
and I was on
one of the trading cards.

00:15:40.705 --> 00:15:42.207
This was a 3D action film.

00:15:42.207 --> 00:15:45.043
I was in an office both scenes.

00:15:45.043 --> 00:15:48.913
My trading card is just me
mid-talking.

00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.416
It's like this.

00:15:51.416 --> 00:15:54.752
But it's 3D, so it's
a little bit closer.

00:15:54.752 --> 00:15:56.488
It's like here.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:59.791
And one time I left SNL

00:15:59.791 --> 00:16:02.360
and someone asked me
to sign this card

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.862
that I had personally
never seen.

00:16:03.862 --> 00:16:07.032
So I autographed it.
And that was the end of it.

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:11.469
And then I found out
that they had put it on eBay.

00:16:11.469 --> 00:16:15.707
And the only reason
I found out about it is...

you know, I go to his office
and I'm knocking on his door

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:29.354

to talk to him about something.

and he goes, "Ohhhh!

to knock!"
