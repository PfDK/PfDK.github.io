00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,913
And she said, "That's fine,
I'll wait as long as it takes,"

177
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,381
and he doesn't have
the heart to tell her

178
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,249
that she's only going to live
another two weeks.

179
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,617
Like, that's how cicadas work.

180
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:39,952
And so then he --

181
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,823
a bug who has never cared
for another insect --

182
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,458
gets Nathan Lane,
played by Nathan Lane,

183
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,296
to gather his Broadway friends
and do one show for his friend

184
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,197
before she passes away.

185
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,501
And then, after she dies,
the last scene,

186
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,337
he goes to a Mets game
by himself

187
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:02,641
and for the first time
in his life, he cries.

188
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,443
Not because
his friend is dead,

189
00:09:05,443 --> 00:09:08,781
but because the Mets blow
a four-run lead in the ninth.

[ Laughter ]

191
00:09:13,151 --> 00:09:16,756
And the final song
is a torch song

192
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,425
called "Where Have You Gone,
John Franco?"

193
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,294
[ Laughter ]

194
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,967
And when you mention
Christine Baranski

195
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,469
and John Franco
in the same bit,

196
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,772
that is a calculus that I like
to define as

197
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,108
"one for me, one for the crew."

198
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,843
[ Laughter ]

199
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,853
In that song, "Where Have
You Gone, John Franco" --

200
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,756
'Cause critics have seen it.

201
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,660
We're doing -- We've already
done an out-of-town run.

202
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,462
And a lot of the critics
complain that

203
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,363
there's this whole play
about the friendship

204
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,432
between these two bugs
and then the whole ending

205
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,802
is about, like, complaining
about the Mets.

206
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,606
And there's a lyric
that I'm very proud of that

207
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,640
that I feel like if anybody --

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,509
if, like, Lin-Manuel Miranda
rhymed

209
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,012
"Jesse Orosco" with
"arm from Costco"...

00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,683
Like, where do I send the Tony?
But, like, they were like...

212
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:22,688
And I'll just say to all these
out-of-town critics --

213
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,523
If you know so much
about Broadway,

214
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,826
why do you live in New Haven?

215
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,363
That is not the best song.

216
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,998
"Where Have You Gone, John
Franco" is not the best song.

217
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,066
The best...

218
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,904
There's the cockroach...
[ Chuckling ]

219
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,238
The cockroach has a song

220
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,975
where he complains
about the smoking ban,

221
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,643
called

222
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,246
"My Titanic
Hit a Bloomberg."

[ Laughter ]

224
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:52,651
And then the title song,

225
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,920
"Cicada, Cicada" --
everybody's very surprised

226
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,222
because it's actually
not about bugs at all.

227
00:10:57,222 --> 00:10:59,224
It is sung

228
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:02,894
by Cuban-American Jon Secada,

229
00:11:02,894 --> 00:11:05,898
and it's about how people
sometimes say his name wrong.

[ Laughter ]

231
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,469
You might --
I mean, because again,

232
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:14,440
this is the same group of people
every week at our show.

233
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,509
Like, there's no new people
come here.

234
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,577
You might hear a new laugh.
This is very exciting for me.

235
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,013
One of my oldest friends,
Pete Grosz, is here.

236
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,449
He came tonight,
and it's so...

237
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,285
Pete is an award-winning writer.

238
00:11:27,285 --> 00:11:30,122
He's one of our greatest
living improvisers.

239

But you may know him...

00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:36,795
If you saw him, you may know
him because for years, he...

241
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,797
was the Hamburglar.

00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,176
"Robble robble," my friend.

244
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,279
This is a correction for
somebody who wrote something.

245
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,081
This was now months ago

246
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,951
and I almost --
I almost wanted to let it go,

247
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,318
but I kind of can't
get it out of my head,

248
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:04,256
so I did want to mention it,
which is...

249
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:09,428
Someone who I don't think
cares for me.

250
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,163
And a lot of these corrections,
I can tell

251
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,665
that behind it is...

252
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,835
affection.

253
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,003
This was a person
who was referencing the fact

254
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,006
that I am tan.

255
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:26,078
And in their comment,
they had one word misspelled,

256
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,414
and it's why I can't
get it out of my head.

257
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,817
They put an "A" in a word

258
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,251
where there's not supposed
to be an "A."

259
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,920
So, I'm gonna tell you
what they wrote,

260
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,256
and see if you can pick out
the misspelling

261
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:42,160
where there was "A" where
there shouldn't be an "A."

262
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,800
What they wrote was,
"Hey, bro, what's with the tan?

"Hey, bro,
what's with the tan?

as Donald Trump."

00:13:01,646 --> 00:13:03,816

I mean, don't beat yourself up,
but it massively changes.

explain what a taint is.

It's like here.

It, like...

276
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,409
It -- It taint the chin,
but it, like, taint the neck.

00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,777
It's like...

is fight with you guys

about which
my impressions are good.

00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,421
Okay, like, it's not...

282
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:45,991
Because I'm not mad at you

283
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,360
about the fact
that you don't

284
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,464
have an ear for
what people sound like.

285
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,901
But I have come
to the conclusion

286
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:59,371
that I do not have
a good Christoph Waltz.

287
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,308
And I only did it
in the first place

288
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:06,111
because some of you said
my Werner Herzog

289
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,579
sounded like Christoph Waltz,
and again,

290
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:11,116
you were wrong, 'cause
it's unimpeachably good.

291
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,318
And I feel really bad
because I love Christoph Waltz.

292
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:15,587
And I was thinking about like
when he -- and I know for,

293
00:14:15,587 --> 00:14:17,489
like, foreign audiences,
they may have seen him before.

294
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,958
But when he showed up
in "Inglourious Basterds,"

295
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:21,860
first time
most Americans saw him,

296
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,464
it was like the most
memorable arrival

00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,933
of a thespian in film
in the last fif--

298
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,569
The only thing

299
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,904
that I would say rivals it

300
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:34,239
is when I

301
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,476

to the Center of the Earth."

307
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,860
I did not have a big part
in this film,

308
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,963
as evidenced by the fact
that both of my scenes

309
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,132
took place on the surface
of the Earth.

311
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:06,305
I was in the first --
one of the first scenes.

312
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:10,041
And I'm just going
to paraphrase my scene,

313
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,477
but I was a scientist who said
something along the lines

314
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:14,312
to Brendan Frazier of,

315
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:18,450
"You're never going to
the center of the Earth!"

316
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,953
And then I had a scene at the
very end of the movie, where --

317
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,121
and again, I'm paraphrasing.

318
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,289
This wasn't the exact line,

319
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:25,324
but something
along the lines of,

"Wha?!"

321
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,997
But this is a true story.

322
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,100

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,702
for "Journey to the Center
of the Earth 3D,"

one of the trading cards.

This was a 3D action film.

00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,043
I was in an office both scenes.

327
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,913
My trading card is just me
mid-talking.

00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,416
It's like this.

a little bit closer.

to sign this card

never seen.

that they had put it on eBay.

I found out about it is...

knocking -- nothing.

Finally, because I --
we work togeth--

there's some times where I need
to talk to him about something.

to knock!"

00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,072
And I said,
"I've been knocking."

349
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,342
He's like, "Ohhh,
maybe I had my headphones in."

350
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,676
Here they are!

351
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,178
I was like, "What?"

352
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,680
[ Laughter ]

353
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,816
[ Laughing ] Like, we're...

354
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,318
And there are some times
where you're just like,

355
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,687
eh, just forget it,
just let it go.

356
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,123
It was like, you know,
it just always...

357
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,727
And then I look and I see --

358
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,195
and again,
I only signed one of them.

359
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,432
I see this autographed
card of mine.

360
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:16,168
And I go, "Where did you
get that?"

361
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,103
He goes, "Whoa,
is this an interrogation?!"

362
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,973
I'm like, "Why is everything
like this?"

363
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:25,210
I'm genuinely curious
why you would have,

364
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,912
like, an autographed
trading card

365
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:31,583
for one of the few movies
I was ever in.

366
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,719
And he's just like...
[ Grumbling ]

367
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,454
[ Laughter ]

368
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:38,323
And he goes "Maybe, uh..."

369
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:42,861
"Maybe I'm proud of you."

370
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,197
[ Laughter ]

371
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:49,368
And again, like...

372
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,672
I've known him for like 20 years
and I've never --

373
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,140
I've never expected anything
like that from him.

374
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,410
He's just so relentlessly mean.

375
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,879
Pete, on the other hand --

376
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,715
you know, we're coming up
on 30 years, Buddy.

377
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,017
We have...

378
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:09,354
burgled a lot of hams.

379
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,057
You, the kind of friend
that I would expect that from.

380
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,525
But not Shoemaker.

381
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,893
And he goes,
"Maybe I'm proud of you."

382
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:18,463
And I go,
"What? Really? Why?"

383
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:21,299
He goes,"You know, it might not
have been the best movie,

384
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,468
but you were in it.

385
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:26,638
On the big screen.

386
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,173
In 3D."

387
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,678
"So it was worth every penny
I paid for it

388
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,681
to have it on my wall."

389
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:40,352
And I was like, "Wow."

390
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,086
And then I said, "What did you
have to pay for it?"

391
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:44,923
He goes, "They paid me money
to take it!"

392
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,859
[ Laughter ]

393
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,431
He goes, "Now maybe you wanna
put in some headphones!"

394
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,233
[ Laughter ]

395
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,402
I think, uh...

396
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,270
I think
that's about everything.

397
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,272
Oh!

398
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,608
Uh, [bleep] piss [bleep] fart.

399
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,443
[ Laughter ]

400
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,946
See what got through.

401
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,181
See you next week.
